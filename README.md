# NoahsArk
Free implementation of the Noah's ark

## Solutech's subject 
The subject was deliberately large and open.
I decided to go toward a filling system that 
would have come handy for Noah. The algorithm 
basically  take a list of all the animals
and places them in the different decks and rooms
of the Ark respecting rules such as : 
+ `not a bigger Carnivorous in a room that has small preys` 
+ `never exceed the deck weight limit`
+ `every room has a max weight and a capacity` 
etc...

My implementation is a best fit with retro-traversal.
You can see it as a Malloc (in C) implementation.

You can note that almost everything in this project
in regard of science is pretty accurate (size/weight ration,
names of classes, ...)
